# Implementing-Explainable-AI-and-Trustworthy-Model-for-Financial-Decision-Making

This project explores the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to credit risk assessment, aiming to enhance transparency, fairness, and interpretability in loan decision-making. By combining a Random Forest model with explainability techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), the system provides global and local insights into the factors driving model predictions.

**Technologies Used:**
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: SHAP, LIME, Scikit-learn
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Plotly
Deployment: Interactive UI for end-user accessibility
